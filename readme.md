# Getting Started

So this is a python script you can use to automatically switch tabs in Windows.

As of now it is tested on windows and works fine on it.

Prerequisite:

1. Install Python from Internet.

2. Install the required dependencies, google it out if you don't know how to install one.

3. Download "switch.py" file.

4. To use, simply run the script and it will automatically do its job.

TY :)
